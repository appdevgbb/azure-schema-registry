# Azure Schema Registry samples

The [Azure Schema Registry](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/schema-registry-overview) provides a repository for developers that wish to store, define and enforce schemas in their distributed applications and services.

## Samples

These samples demonstrate how to use the schema registry to encode and decode events. The samples also show how to use the schema registry with [Azure Event Hubs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-about) when producing and consuming events.
